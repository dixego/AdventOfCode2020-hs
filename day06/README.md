Two one-liners! I believe this is the ultimate expression of Haskell's expresivity and
potential for conciseness. *Functional programming, baby!*

### Notes

- The hardest part about becoming slightly-better-than-beginner level at Haskell so far is
  remembering which functions are already defined in a common library and which you need
  to define yourself.
