Had a little bit of trouble with part 2 of this one, for some reason I wasn't getting the
correct result. Had to reimplement my matching function into something that ended up a lot
more concise, so I guess that's good. Rule parser was also a bit annoying to implement,
but I continue to be impressed with how intuitive Parsec is.
