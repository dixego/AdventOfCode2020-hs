I'm not proud of this one.

It's really slow. Embarassingly slow, really. Ideally, looking for a specific bag's
contents should be O(1) but since I'm still reluctant to use any sort of more efficient
mapping library like `Data.Map`, looking up a bag's contents is O(n).
However, it does work.

### Notes
- Lord forgive me.
