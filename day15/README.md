Another slow one! Once again I'm not sure I can do anything to speed this one up.
The first version I wrote had a map storing last and second-to-last occurrences of each
number and it would stack overflow when I tried to run it lol. Eventually realized I only
needed the last occurrence and now it works and finishes in around 50 seconds. Not that
bad, honestly.
