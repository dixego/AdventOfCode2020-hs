ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER INTERPTERER. Used this opportunity to learn about Parsec's Expr
module, which very concisely (if kinda weirdly) allows one to define a parser for a
language of expressions by defining operators with their associativity and precedence.
With that, the difference between part 1 and part 2 becomes only changing the order of
precedence for both operations.
